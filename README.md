# M-SET: Multi-drone Sensing Experimentation Testbed
This project can be used to execute drone sensing missions on a testbed which aims to provide a real-world simulation of drones on an experimentation testbed. It uses the [EPOS](https://github.com/epournaras/EPOS) algorithm to generate efficient paths, and then applies collision avoidance algorithms as EPOS does not account for collisions. There is also support to execute these paths on a swarm of [Crazyflies](https://www.bitcraze.io/products/crazyflie-2-1/).
